# My Current Go-To Tools and Services

These are my favorite tools/services as of April 2025. Please note: I use a Mac and some of the software below isn't available on other platforms.

## [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/)

The ways I use Cursor have evolved over the year and a half I've been using it. I absolutely love the latest update introduction of agent mode. Writing code has never been more fun.

## [Superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com/)

Superwhisper STT (Speech-to-Text) is the best I've used. If you aren't using a tool like this daily, you are missing out.

## [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/)

The "Pragmatic Programmer" dedicates an entire chapter to the "The Power of Plain Text". Keeping your second brain in markdown is a no-brainer. Foam is a VS Code (and thus Cursor) plugin that makes working with a markdown note repository a pure joy. 

## [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/)

LibreChat is a best in class open source chatbot platform. Connect it to a variety of model providers and models including locally hosted. [Build local no-code agents](/local-no-code-mcp-agents) by plugging in your favorite MCP servers.

## [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)

Claude desktop is easier to get up and running than Librechat but is limited to Anthropic models. It also offers MCP server integration and has the fantastic artifacts feature - if you're unfamiliar with it, check out this [video](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/1060330011/82549d714e/analytics) where I use artifacts to organize messy unstructured information.

## [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)

Hosted postgres with a bunch of great authentication and other features. All with a generous free tier.

## [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

Hosting web apps with the git integration and generous free tier is such a great experience.

## [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)

Changing terminals is a pain. Warp is a modern terminal that I think is worth making the jump.

## [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

Ollama is a great way to run local models. Librechat has support for Ollama as a model provider. It's how I use my favorite local model Qwen 2.5 7B.

## [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)

Raycast is a great productivity tool. I mainly use it for app launcher and window manager. I recently upgraded to the pay version to get the custom Window Manager Commands.

## [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

I use Foam (linked above) to work with my notes repository when I'm at the computer and I use Obsidian from my phone.

## [Arc](https://arc.net/)

Arc is a marvelous new take on the dusty old browser. Features like canvas, browse for me, and ask over page are so slick.

# Used some, but not currently

## [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)

Before moving to Librechat, I used LM Studio to run and interact with local models. If Librechat is too much to setup and you're looking for a one-stop UI for local model interaction, LM Studio is a great option.

## [Loveable.dev](https://loveable.dev/)

I really enjoyed using tools in this category. I may circle back to low-code agent development in the future. Now that Cursor has agent mode, I've been spending less time with lovable.dev. Software engineers and product managers should try it out. It's so easy to create a website, I [made one just to share](https://moab-adventure-sharer.lovable.app/) the itinerary for a camping trip with family and friends.


# On the radar, but haven't tried yet

Both of these seem compelling, but I've been able to do what I need with other tools. Still, I should give them a try at some point.
