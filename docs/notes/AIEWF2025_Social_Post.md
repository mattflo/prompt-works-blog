Just got back from the AI Engineer World's Fair 2025 in SF and my mind is still buzzing! ðŸ¤¯

Hands down the highest signal-to-noise ratio conference in AI - and this year delivered!

The landscape is shifting fast:
- Google dropped some unexpected moves that have everyone talking ðŸ‘€
- Three letter acronyms are apparently the secret sauce to industry disruption (who knew?) 
- Agent infrastructure isn't just hot - it's absolutely on fire ðŸ”¥

If you're building with AI, this is THE conference to be at. Missed it? I've got you covered with a quick breakdown and the must-see highlights!
